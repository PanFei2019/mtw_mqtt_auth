//! Static section is written once during manufacturing, and never again.  This section includes
//! per-device information like crystal trimming information and an assigned address like BD_ADDR
//! for Bluetooth devices or a MAC address for ethernet or WLAN devices.  The static section also
//! includes key layout information like whether a volatile section is present and if so, where it
//! is located.
//!                                                                                         <br><br>
//! Dynamic section is written during manufacturing.  This section might be subject to upgrades in
//! the field, by the end user.  An example of such an upgrade process is USB device firmware
//! upgrade.  If this section is subject to upgrade in the field, then a failsafe config must be
//! present, which if present would either force the device into an upgrade-only mode, or fall back
//! to the un-upgraded behavior it would have exhibited when it left the factory.
//!                                                                                         <br><br>
//! Volatile section is used to hold information that can change at runtime, for example storing
//! pairing information for pairing with other devices.  The volatile section is implemented as
//! failsafe as possible for the target media, such that the most recently written "nugget" of
//! information is subject to loss, but contents that were present before a given write operation
//! will be preserved.
//!                                                                                         <br><br>
//! The "volatile" nomenclature is somewhat misleading because this section is only ever present on
//! NVRAM (nonvolatile memory).  The "volatile" nomenclature is simply used to highlight the fact
//! that the contents are subject to loss.  This is generally a non-issue, but if multiple "nuggets"
//! of information are interdependent but written independently, then it is possible for one
//! "nugget" in the interdependent set to be lost, in which case the firmware that uses this
//! information needs to be ready to recognize that situation and take appropriate action to discard
//! or if possible repair the rest of the set.  If no "nuggets" of volatile information form
//! interdependent sets then loss of power during a write operation is functionally equivalent to
//! loss of power immediately before the write operation was initiated.
//!                                                                                         <br><br>

//! Only the static and dynamic sections are relevant.  The distinction between the two halves is
//! more or less irrelevant, merely being a reflection of the NVRAM organization.  Nonetheless, the
//! location in which certain pieces of information are stored is influenced by the NVRAM
//! organization.  A volatile section should never be specified for RAM config data.
