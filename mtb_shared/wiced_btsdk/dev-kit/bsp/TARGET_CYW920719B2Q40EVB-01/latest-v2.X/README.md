# CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01

### Overview

The Cypress CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW20719, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.1 wireless MCU device. The CYW20719 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE/BR/EDR. The CYW20719 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the devices's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.
