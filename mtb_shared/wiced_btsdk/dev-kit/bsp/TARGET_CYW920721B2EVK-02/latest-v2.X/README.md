# CYW920721B2EVK-02

### Overview

The Cypress CYW920721B2EVK-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW20721, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.1 wireless MCU device for Audio. The CYW20721 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE/BR/EDR. The CYW20721 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.

* CYW20721B2 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth 5.1-compliant wireless MCU packaged into a SiP Module with external Low Noise Amplifier and Power Amplifier (eLNA/ePA)
* Audio Arduino shield with on-board microphones, audio codec chip, headphone and speaker output
* On-board sensors - a 9-axis motion sensor (3D digital linear acceleration sensor, 3D digital angular rate sensor, and 3D digital magnetic sensor) and a thermistor
* User switches and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming and USB-UART bridge

### Kit Contents
