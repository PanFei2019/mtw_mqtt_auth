# Cypress Emulated EEPROM Middleware Library

### Overview
The Emulated EEPROM middleware emulates an EEPROM device in the PSoC device flash memory. The EEPROM middleware operates on the top of the Flash driver included in the PSoC 6 Peripheral Driver Library (psoc6pdl).

Use the Emulated EEPROM to store nonvolatile data on a target device, with wear leveling and restoring corrupted data from a redundant copy.

### Features
* EEPROM-Like Non-Volatile Storage
* Easy to use Read and Write API
* Optional Wear Leveling
* Optional Redundant Data storage

### Quick Start
Refer to the [API Reference Guide Quick Start Guide](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/emeeprom/em_eeprom_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#section_em_eeprom_quick_start) section for step-by-step instruction how to enable the Emulated EEPROM Middleware Library.
