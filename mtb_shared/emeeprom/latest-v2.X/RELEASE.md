# Cypress Emulated EEPROM Middleware Library 2.0

### What's Included?
Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the [API Reference Guide](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/emeeprom/em_eeprom_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) for a complete description of the Emulated EEPROM Middleware.
The revision history of the Emulated EEPROM Middleware is also available on the [API Reference Guide Changelog](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/emeeprom/em_eeprom_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#section_em_eeprom_changelog).
New in this release:
* Updated major and minor version defines for consistency with other libraries
* Updated documentation for user experience improvement
* Added migration guide from PSoC Creator Em EEPROM component
* Added mechanism to restore corrupted redundant copy from the main data copy

### Defect Fixes
* Fixed MISRA Violation
* Fixed defect of the Cy_Em_EEPROM_Read() function when Emulated EEPROM data corruption in some cases caused infinite loop.
* Fixed defect of the Cy_Em_EEPROM_Read() function when the function returns incorrect data after restoring data from redundant copy.
